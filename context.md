CSIT 314 (2025) Systems Development Method-
ologies
Group Project
You will work together as a team to develop a business-related software project.
You may use any programming language, any development tool, and
any project management tool to complete the project. The final deliverables
will include a project report, user manual, and source code.
Important Notes
• This project description provides only the high-level goals of this project.
Accordingly, the team MUST elicit more detailed and specific require-
ments, such as getting feedback from your tutorial demonstrator. We
acknolwdge that the requirements may change during the development
phrase project (this is to simulate real-life projects).
• You need to form a group of up to 5 people by the Wednesday of
Week 3. Please submit the group details via Moodle. One submission
for one Group
• Undergraduates and postgraduates CANOT be in the same group.
• All work must be submitted to the Moodle site and email submission will
NOT be accepted.
Task
Your Tasks are to
1. Form and structure your group (up to 5 students), allocating roles and
responsibilities to your members.
2. Choose one software development methodology (e.g., Agile methods such
as Scrum) for your group to follow. Select one project management tool
(such as Taiga) that supports that methodology to use.
3. Choose any programming language and tools to complete the development
of a given software system (described below). This should include all
software development activities from requirements specification, through
design, implementation, and testing.
Note: Refer to Moodle for more detailed requirements, grading cri-
teria, and submission deadlines.
Project Description: Event Management System
Background Organizing and managing events, such as conferences, corpo-
rate meetings, or social gatherings, often involves multiple moving parts, from
scheduling and ticketing to attendee management and communication. Many
1
small event organizers lack an efficient system to handle registrations, payments,
and real-time updates.
This project aims to develop an Event Management System that allows orga-
nizers to create events, manage registrations, and communicate with attendees,
while also enabling users to search and register for events.
Core Functions
• User Portal: User Registration & Authentication, Event Discovery
(Search), Event Registration & Ticketing, Notification System, etc.
• Organizer Portal: Event Creation & Management, Attendee Management,
Payment Processing, Reports, etc.
Basic Workflow Users begin by browsing available events on the platform.
Events can be filtered based on types/categories such as conferences, music
concerts, and networking sessions, as well as by date, location, and
price range.
Once the user finds an event of interest, they can proceed to register. Registra-
tion may offer two options:
• General Registration: Users can book a free ticket or pay for a standard
entry ticket.
• VIP/Premium Registration: Users pay a higher fee for additional
benefits such as exclusive seating, meet-and-greet opportunities, or extra
event materials.
Upon completing the registration, users are directed to the payment gateway,
where they can securely complete their transaction. If the payment is successful,
the system generates a digital ticket, which users can present at the event for
check-in.
Simultaneously, event organizers receive real-time updates on ticket sales
and can manage their attendee list through the admin dashboard. They have
the ability to approve or reject registrations, send event reminders, and
modify event details if necessary. In case of event cancellations, the system will
automatically process refunds and notify affected users.
To ensure system robustness, teams must generate sufficient test data, including
at least 10 event organizers and 50 event registrations. A script should
be written to randomly generate this data. Additionally, the implementation of
continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) is mandatory
to ensure automated deployment, testing, and updates.

Final Notes
This project is designed to simulate real-world software development, re-
quiring you to deal with changing requirements, team collaboration, and
technical challenges. Be proactive in managing tasks, gathering feedback,
and refining your implementation.
